## üß† Business Understanding

Jaya Jaya Institut, a respected higher education institution, faces a significant challenge‚Äîhigh student dropout rates. Many students fail to complete their studies, affecting the institution's academic reputation and financial sustainability.

To address this, the institution leveraged **Machine Learning** and **Business Intelligence** to identify at-risk students early and enable proactive intervention.

### üîß Business Problems
- **High Dropout Rates**  
- **No Early Warning System**  
- **Lack of Data-Driven Insight**

### üîç Project Scope
- Data collection & exploration  
- ML model development (Random Forest)  
- Metabase dashboard for visualization  
- Streamlit prototype for predictions

## üì¶ Preparation

**Data Source**:  
[Students' Performance Dataset (Dicoding)](https://github.com/dicodingacademy/dicoding_dataset/blob/main/students_performance/data.csv)

**Environment Setup**:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn streamlit sqlalchemy python-dotenv psycopg2-binary
````

## üìä Business Dashboard
![Metabase Dashboard](./hanugafc-dashboard.png)
**Tool**: Metabase
**Database**: PostgreSQL

### üîç Key Visualizations:

1. **Dropout vs Graduate Distribution**
2. **Status by Gender**
3. **Admission Grade vs Status**
4. **Age at Enrollment vs Status**
5. **Scholarship vs Status**
6. **Debtor vs Status**

### üìå Insight Highlights:

* Lower admission grades and older age ‚Üí higher dropout risk
* Scholarship holders & non-debtors ‚Üí higher graduation rates

## üöÄ Running Metabase via Docker

```bash
docker pull metabase/metabase:latest
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /path/to/metabase.db.mv.db:/metabase.db/metabase.db.mv.db \
  --name metabase-jaya-jaya-institut \
  metabase/metabase:latest
```

**Access:**
`http://localhost:3000`
**Login:**

* Email: `johndhoe123@mail.com`
* Password: `metabase-root123-john`

> Note: You need to connect the metabase with your own database.
